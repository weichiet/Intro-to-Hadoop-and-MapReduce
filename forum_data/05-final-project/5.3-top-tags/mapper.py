Top Tags

We are interested seeing what are the top tags used in posts.

Write a mapreduce program that would output Top 10 tags, ordered by the number of questions they appear in.

For an extra challenge you can think how to get a top 10 list of tags, where they are ordered by some weighted score by your choice.
